# Games
our project is name Micro Boi our main objective of te application was to be able to reproduce 
simple games on a hand help devices like they used to hand out at mcdonalds when we were younger.
we started looking for ideas online of what we can use the microbit for. I ran in to a video on youutube
that enables the micro bit to play flappy bird a simple game that became very popular and took the world 
by storm in 2013. the idea f the game was to make a bird fly over pipes and how ever many pipes you passed
withought hitting the pipe would be your score. Andrew and jose helped me do some aditional research on how games 
function on the micro bit and how we were able to convert code to enable it to work with the microbit. 
David started developing code to do a test on the microbit we started with rock paper scisors and eventually
added in coin flip which are basic ones. upon succesfully adding 2 games we were going to add the falppy bird
game itself but ran inn to issues because it would break the rest of the code we were able to figure
out that the games have to be seperated in to classes and defneitions so they woudltn interfere with eachother .
